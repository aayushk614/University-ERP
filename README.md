# SAP
The University Student Activity Portal (SAP) project is dedicated to optimizing administrative processes associated with course management in the University system. Its primary goals are to improve operational efficiency and facilitate informed decision-making. The SAP portal empowers students and administrators by offering them a centralized, user-friendly platform for accessing and managing courses.

To achieve this, we have integrated four distinct datasets into the system. These datasets include faculty information, student details, and subject information. It's worth noting that for the Faculty database, data was sourced from both the IIIT Delhi website and the institute's submission for the NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) ranking.

Open Tools: JDK (Java Development Kit): JDK is an essential tool for the development and execution of Java-based applications, including the software in question. MySQL Databases: MySQL databases serve as the core data storage and management system for the application, handling data storage, retrieval, and organization.

Software Utilized: Java: Java programming language is the primary software used for developing the application. It provides the necessary framework for building the system's functionality. MySQL Workbench: MySQL Workbench is employed as a graphical user interface (GUI) tool to interact with the MySQL database. It facilitates tasks such as database creation, management, and querying.

The development and execution of the system are facilitated by the JDK environment where the SAP system's logic and functionality are created, MySQL databases are used for efficient data storage and retrieval, MySQL Workbench simplifies database management and querying tasks. Together, these tools and technologies enable the development, execution, and customization of the SAP system, ensuring efficient course management within the university.
